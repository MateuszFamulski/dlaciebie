>Today, endodontics, commonly known as root canal treatment, is a key component of modern conservative dentistry. At our dental office, we pay great attention to this specialty, using the latest available technology and an endodontic microscope. With these tools, we are able to remove infected tissue from inside the tooth with great precision, thus preserving the tooth and protecting it from the need for extraction.
>
>#### How Does Root Canal Treatment Work?
>Canal treatment involves the removal of infected dental pulp - the tissue inside the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels. Once the infected tissue is removed, the tooth canals are carefully cleaned, disinfected and then filled with a material that prevents reinfection. As a result, a tooth that would have had to be removed without root canal treatment can be preserved.
>
>#### Advanced Technologies at the Guard of Health
>The use of an endodontic microscope during root canal treatment significantly increases its effectiveness. It allows more accurate localization and treatment of all dental canals, including those that are difficult to access, which is essential to ensure the longevity of the treatment. Modern technologies, such as digital X-rays and specialized root canal cleaning tools, make it possible to precisely remove infected tissue and protect the tooth from further problems.
>
>#### Endodontic Re-treatment and Specialized Procedures.
>In some cases, despite previous treatment, repeated endodontic intervention is necessary. This can be due to various reasons, such as the development of a new infection or insufficient filling of the canals during the first treatment. At our office, we offer endodontic re-treatment to remove the previously used filling material, re-clean and disinfect the canals, and then fill them properly.
>
>Additionally, specialized endodontic procedures, such as the removal of a broken tool from a canal or the reconstruction of a crown on fiberglass, are performed with extreme precision. These advanced procedures require not only specialized knowledge, but also the appropriate equipment at our disposal. As a result, we are able to restore teeth to their functionality and aesthetics, even in complex cases.

>#### Importance of Endodontics for Oral Health
>Endodontics is not only a lifesaver for teeth at risk of extraction. It's also an important part of preventive health care that avoids a number of serious complications, such as the spread of infection to other parts of the body. With root canal treatment, it is possible to preserve a natural tooth, which is always preferable to losing it and having to use dentures or implants.
>
>In summary, endodontics at our office is a combination of science, precision and experience that allows us to successfully save teeth, giving our patients a chance to preserve their natural smile. We make sure that each procedure is carried out with the utmost care, minimizing patient discomfort and maximizing the chances of successful treatment.
