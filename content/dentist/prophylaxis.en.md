>In our dental office, we firmly believe that prevention is the key to long-term health and a beautiful smile. A healthy mouth not only contributes to overall health, but also affects the mood and self-confidence of our patients. That's why we place great emphasis on a wide range of preventive treatments that aim to prevent dental and gum problems before they even occur.
>
>#### Regular Check-up Visits
>The cornerstone of effective preventive care is regular check-up visits. They allow early detection and prevention of dental problems such as tooth decay and gum disease. During these visits, we conduct a thorough review of your oral health, allowing you to quickly take necessary protective or curative measures.
>
>#### Scaling and Sandblasting
>Scaling is a procedure that removes tartar from the surface of teeth, which is key to preventing gum disease. Sandblasting, on the other hand, is a dental cleaning method that removes stains and deposits, restoring teeth to their natural whiteness. Both procedures play an important role in maintaining the health and aesthetics of the smile.
>
>#### Manual Curettage
>Hand curettage is a procedure for deep cleaning of the space between the teeth and gums, which is often used to treat advanced inflammation of the gums. With this procedure, it is possible to remove bacteria and debris from deep gum pockets, preventing further development of the disease.
>
>#### Treatment of Gingival Pockets and Mucosal Lesions.
>In addition to standard preventive treatments, our team of specialists also treats specific problems such as gingival pickles and oral mucosal lesions. With our comprehensive approach to oral health, we are able to provide comprehensive care and protection against a variety of conditions.
>
>#### Patient Education
>An integral part of our work is educating patients about proper oral hygiene and a healthy lifestyle. During each visit, we share tips on proper tooth brushing technique, flossing, and choosing the right oral hygiene products. We believe that knowledge and awareness are as important as regular preventive care.
>
>In summary, prevention is the foundation on which oral health is based. Our team will go to great lengths to make each preventive visit effective and as stress-free as possible, and our comprehensive approach to prevention will keep your teeth and gums in excellent condition. We invite you to visit our office regularly, so that together we can keep your smile healthy and beautiful for years to come.
