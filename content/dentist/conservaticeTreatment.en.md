>Preservative treatment plays a fundamental role in dentistry, aiming to protect teeth from further damage and restore their natural function and aesthetics. At our dental office, we focus on offering advanced treatment options that not only ensure the health of teeth, but also meet the aesthetic expectations of our patients.

>#### Modern Light-Cured Materials
>One of the key elements of our approach to restorative treatment is the use of modern light-curing materials for fillings. These advanced composites have exceptional durability and aesthetics, perfectly mimicking the natural appearance of the tooth. As a result, patients can enjoy not only protection from further caries development, but also a beautiful smile with no visible signs of dental intervention.

>#### Extensive Composite Restorations
>For patients with extensive cavities, we offer comprehensive composite restorations that restore the original shape, function and aesthetics of teeth. This method effectively restores teeth damaged by decay or trauma, while preserving as much natural tooth tissue as possible. Composite restorations are the ideal solution for those who want a natural-looking smile.

>#### Teeth Suturing
>Tooth splinting is a procedure used for excessive tooth mobility that can result from periodontal disease, trauma or other dental problems. Through the use of special stabilizing splints, we are able to secure moving teeth, providing additional support and allowing them to function properly. This is a non-invasive treatment method that can significantly improve patients' comfort.
