+++

>In our dental office, we understand how important it is to have a full set of healthy teeth not only for your health, but also for your self-confidence. That's why we offer comprehensive implant services for people who have lost one or more teeth and are looking for a permanent and aesthetically satisfying solution.
>
>#### What Are Dental Implants?
>Tooth implants are small screws made of titanium or other biocompatible materials that are implanted into the jawbone in place of a lost tooth. Once they are installed, a prosthetic restoration, such as a crown, bridge or denture, which looks and functions like a natural tooth, is fitted to the implant.
>
>#### Implantation Process
>The process begins with an initial consultation, during which we carefully assess the patient's oral health and needs. Thanks to advanced diagnostic methods such as computed tomography (CBCT), we are able to accurately plan the location and angle of the implant, which is crucial for its subsequent functionality and aesthetics.
>
>The implant procedure is carried out under local anesthesia, which ensures comfort and minimizes patient discomfort. The implant is followed by a process of healing and integration with the bone, known as osteointegration, which takes several to several weeks. Once this process is complete, a prosthetic restoration is fitted to the implant.
>
>#### Advantages of Implants
>Tooth implants offer many advantages over traditional restorative methods such as bridges or dentures. First, they are a permanent solution that can serve the patient for many years or even a lifetime. Second, implants not only restore chewing function, but also help maintain the healthy bone structure of the jaw, preventing bone atrophy. In addition, dental implants offer exceptional aesthetics, as they are almost indistinguishable from natural teeth.
