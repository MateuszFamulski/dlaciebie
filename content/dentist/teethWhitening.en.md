>Tooth whitening is one of the most sought-after aesthetic procedures that can significantly improve the appearance of your smile. At our dental office, we offer a wide range of professional whitening methods that are safe for dental health and can adapt to each patient's individual needs.
>
>#### Office Whitening
>Office whitening is a fast and effective way to achieve a white smile. This procedure is performed directly in the dental office under the supervision of our specialists. We use specialized whitening preparations that are activated by light, which significantly speeds up the process and allows you to achieve immediate results. In-office whitening is ideal for people who want to quickly improve the aesthetics of their smile, such as before an important event.
>
>#### Overlay Whitening
>The overlay method is an alternative to in-office whitening that allows you to perform the procedure at home. The patient receives custom-fitted trays filled with a special whitening gel, which are worn for a specified period of time each day. This method is a bit slower than in-office whitening, but allows the patient to gradually achieve the desired effect while maintaining full control over the process.
>
>#### Dead Tooth Whitening
>Specialized dead tooth whitening treatment is a unique offering of our office, aimed at patients whose teeth have changed color due to root canal treatment. Dead teeth often darken, which can affect the aesthetics of the entire smile. Thanks to advanced whitening methods, we are able to restore the natural color of such teeth, which is especially important for patients who value the aesthetic appearance of their smile.
>
>#### Safety and Efficiency
>The safety of our patients is our top priority, which is why all whitening methods offered are thoroughly tested and approved by specialists. Prior to treatment, each patient undergoes a detailed consultation, during which we assess oral health and match the most appropriate whitening method.
