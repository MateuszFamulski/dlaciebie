>#### How Does Laser Carbon Peeling Work? 
>Our laser carbon peeling technology uses the unique properties of activated carbon, which is applied to the surface of the skin. Then, using a precise laser pulse, energy is absorbed by the carbon particles, resulting in controlled heating of the skin and removal of dead skin and impurities. The result? The skin is deeply cleansed, renewed and radiant.
